# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements ClashDisplay-Variable.ttf as the default font family for all Text elements in the React Native/Expo application. The implementation ensures consistent typography across the entire application by configuring the custom font to be used automatically without requiring explicit font family declarations on individual Text components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ClashDisplay to be the default font family for all Text elements, so that I don't need to manually specify the font on every Text component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL register the ClashDisplay-Variable.ttf font file
2. WHEN any Text component is rendered without an explicit fontFamily prop THEN the system SHALL apply ClashDisplay as the default font
3. WHEN the font fails to load THEN the system SHALL fallback to the platform's default font gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the font configuration to work across all platforms (iOS, Android, Web), so that the application maintains consistent typography regardless of the target platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs on iOS THEN the system SHALL display ClashDisplay font correctly
2. WHEN the application runs on Android THEN the system SHALL display ClashDisplay font correctly
3. WHEN the application runs on Web THEN the system SHALL display ClashDisplay font correctly
4. WHEN the font is not supported on a platform THEN the system SHALL fallback to appropriate platform defaults

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing ThemedText components to automatically use the new default font, so that the typography change is applied consistently without modifying existing component usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ThemedText components are rendered THEN the system SHALL apply ClashDisplay as the font family
2. WHEN custom fontFamily props are provided to ThemedText THEN the system SHALL respect the custom font over the default
3. WHEN font weights are specified THEN the system SHALL maintain proper font weight rendering with ClashDisplay

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the font loading to be handled efficiently during app startup, so that there are no visible font flashes or loading delays that impact user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load the font before rendering any text
2. WHEN the font is loading THEN the system SHALL prevent font flash (FOUT/FOIT) issues
3. WHEN the font loading completes THEN the system SHALL render all text with the correct font immediately
